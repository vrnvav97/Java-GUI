This Core Java Program demonstrates the concept of Sentiment Analysis. In reality it involves a much different process with the usage of Natural Language Processing, Text Analysis and text mining. Sentiment Analysis is used for the interpretation and classification of emotions which could be either positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment Analysis tools allow businesses to identify customer sentiment towards products, brands or services as feedback. This Sentiment Analyser program involves set of features and opinions where features are stored in a 2D array and both positive and negative opinions are stored in a single dimension array.

Example of a sentiment analysis:
Haven't been here in years! Fantastic service and the food was delicious! Definetly will be a frequent flyer! Francisco was very attentive

Results of Sentiment Analysis:
1. Food was delicious
2. Fantastic service

This program supports two types of lanugage patterns:



1. feature was opinion {Food was delicious}
2. opinion feature {Fantastic service}

This program prints a list as string which computes to [0,0,1,0,1] where 0 signifies no opinion for that particular feature, 1 signifies postivie opinion for the feature of that row and subsequently -1 signifies negative opinion for that feature.
