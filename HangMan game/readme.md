Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, and the other tries to guess the word by suggesting letters within a constraint that is limited number of guesses. So I tried to implement this exciting game in Java where Computer would think of a word each time and the user playing the game would try to fill in the blanks in order to guess the word. The user wins the game if he successfully guesses the complete word in given number of allowed guesses
